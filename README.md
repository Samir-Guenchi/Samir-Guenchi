# Hi, I'm Samir 👋

**AI Engineer & NLP Specialist** from Algeria, passionate about making AI accessible for Arabic-speaking communities.

I coach students for the Algerian Olympiad in Informatics and build things that matter.

## The Short Version

I'm a Computer Science student at [ENSIA](https://www.ensia.edu.dz/) who fell in love with AI when I realized it could help bridge the language gap for millions of Arabic speakers. Now I spend my days building NLP systems, mentoring young programmers, and occasionally winning arguments with neural networks.

**Currently working on:** Arabic Q&A systems using RAG — because my language deserves better AI tools.

## What I Actually Do

### 🧠 AI & Machine Learning
I build production-ready ML systems, not just notebooks. My focus:
- **NLP for Arabic** — Tokenization, embeddings, and Q&A systems designed for RTL languages
- **RAG Systems** — Retrieval-augmented generation for domain-specific knowledge
- **Model Evaluation** — Because "it works on my machine" isn't good enough

### 📱 Mobile Development
Flutter apps that solve real problems. My [QR Analyzer](https://github.com/Samir-Guenchi/Qr_Analyzer) uses ML to detect malicious QR codes before you scan them.

### 🏆 Competitive Programming
Coach at the Algerian Olympiad in Informatics. I help students discover that algorithms aren't scary — they're just puzzles with elegance.

## Projects I'm Proud Of

| Project | What it does | Why it matters |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| [Ministry Regulation](https://github.com/Samir-Guenchi/Ministry-Regulation) | Arabic Q&A system with RAG | Makes government regulations searchable in natural language |
| [BUPA Liver Analysis](https://github.com/Samir-Guenchi/BUPA-Liver-Disorder-Analysis) | ML pipeline for medical diagnosis | Reproducible research with proper evaluation methodology |
| [QR Analyzer](https://github.com/Samir-Guenchi/Qr_Analyzer) | Security-focused QR scanner | Protects users from phishing before they click |
| [Search Algorithms](https://github.com/Samir-Guenchi/Search_Algo) | Visual algorithm demonstrations | Teaching tool I use with my Olympiad students |

## Tech I Work With

**Languages:** Python, C++, Dart, JavaScript  
**AI/ML:** TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Hugging Face  
**Mobile:** Flutter  
**Tools:** Linux, Git, LaTeX, Jupyter

I believe in using the right tool for the job, not the trendiest one.
