# Samir Guenchi

Building NLP systems for the 400M+ Arabic speakers who deserve better language tools.

Currently: RAG architecture for Arabic Q&A • Training competitive programmers • CS at ENSIA

## What I'm Building

**Arabic NLP that actually works**  
Most language models treat Arabic as an afterthought. I'm building RAG systems, tokenizers, and Q&A pipelines specifically designed for RTL languages and Arabic morphology.

**Production ML, not just notebooks**  
From medical diagnosis pipelines to security-focused mobile apps, I focus on systems that ship—with proper evaluation, reproducible research, and real impact.

**Algorithms education**  
Coach for Algeria's national programming olympiad. Turns out teaching is the best way to truly understand complexity theory.

## Selected Work

### [Ministry Regulation](https://github.com/Samir-Guenchi/Ministry-Regulation)
RAG-powered Q&A system for Arabic government documents. Natural language search instead of ctrl+F through 500-page PDFs.  
`Python` • `LangChain` • `Arabic NLP`

### [QR Analyzer](https://github.com/Samir-Guenchi/Qr_Analyzer)
Flutter app with ML-based phishing detection. Analyzes QR codes before you scan them, not after you're compromised.  
`Flutter` • `ML` • `Security`

### [BUPA Liver Analysis](https://github.com/Samir-Guenchi/BUPA-Liver-Disorder-Analysis)
End-to-end ML pipeline for medical diagnosis. Focused on reproducibility and proper cross-validation—because healthcare predictions need more than 0.95 accuracy on a test set.  
`Python` • `scikit-learn` • `Medical ML`

### [Search Algorithms Visualizer](https://github.com/Samir-Guenchi/Search_Algo)
Interactive demos of pathfinding algorithms. Built this for my olympiad students who learn better by seeing, not memorizing pseudocode.  
`Python` • `Algorithms` • `Teaching`

## Why This Matters

There are 400 million Arabic speakers online. Most NLP tools were built for English, then poorly adapted. I'm working on infrastructure that treats Arabic as a first-class citizen—proper tokenization for agglutinative morphology, embeddings that understand context in RTL text, RAG systems that handle diacritics.

Also: competitive programming teaches you to think in constraints. That mindset carries over when you're optimizing transformer inference or designing algorithms that scale.
